## Audio-Streaming_App

Overview
This React application allows two users to stream audio between each other using WebRTC. It includes basic audio manipulation, such as applying a frequency and gain filter, and an advanced feature that visualizes the audio stream in real-time. The project is divided into three parts, each building upon the previous steps.

# Features:
Peer-to-peer audio streaming between two users.
Ability to select audio input and output devices.
Apply a frequency and gain filter to the audio stream (Gain: 0.75, Frequency: 200 Hz).
